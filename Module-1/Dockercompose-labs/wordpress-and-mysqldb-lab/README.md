The purpose of this README file is to provide additional information for the docker-compose.yml file, which specifies a multi-container application comprising two services: `db` and `wordpress`. Let's go through the different sections and their meanings:

- ```version: '3'``` : Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file syntax being used.
Services:

- `db` :

    - `image: mysql:5.7` : Specifies the Docker image to be used for the db service, which is the MySQL version 5.7.
    - `volumes` : Mounts a volume named `db_data` to the `/var/lib/mysql` directory inside the container, allowing data to persist across container restarts.
    - `restart` : always: Configures the service to automatically restart if it crashes or stops.
    - `environment` : Sets environment variables used by the MySQL container, such as `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_USER`, and `MYSQL_DATABASE`.
    - `secrets` : Specifies the secrets to be used by the service, such as `db_root_password`, `db_user`, and `db_password`.
    - `networks` : Connects the service to the `wordpress_network`.

- `wordpress` :

    - `image: wordpress` : Specifies the Docker image to be used for the wordpress service, which is the official WordPress image.
    -  `depends_on` : Defines the dependency of the wordpress service on the db service. It ensures that the db service starts before the wordpress service.
    - `ports`: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the wordpress container, allowing access to the WordPress application.
    - `restart: always: Configures the service to automatically restart if it crashes or stops.
    - `environment`: Sets environment variables used by the WordPress container, such as `WORDPRESS_DB_HOST`, `WORDPRESS_DB_USER`, and `WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD`.
    - `secrets`: Specifies the secrets to be used by the service, such as `db_user` and `db_password`.
    - `networks`: Connects the service to the `wordpress_network`.

- `Volumes` :

    - `db_data`: Defines the named volume db_data used by the db service to persist MySQL data.

- `Networks`:

    - `wordpress_network` : Defines the custom network wordpress_network that both services (db and wordpress) are connected to.
        
- `Secrets`:

    - `db_root_password`: Defines a secret named db_root_password that reads the value from the db_root_password.txt file.
    - `db_user`: Defines a secret named db_user that reads the value from the db_user.txt file.
    - `db_password`: Defines a secret named db_password that reads the value from the db_password.txt file.


This Docker Compose file allows you to run a WordPress application connected to a MySQL database container, with secrets used for sensitive information like passwords. The volumes and networks provide data persistence and networking capabilities for the containers.
